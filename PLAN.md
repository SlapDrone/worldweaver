To create a minimal proof-of-concept for WorldWeaver, you can use the following technologies:

    Hugging Face Transformers: For generating static images from character descriptions and producing appropriate music based on scene descriptions, use Hugging Face Transformers, which offers pre-trained generative models for these tasks.

    FastAPI: For creating a simple API to interact with the AI models, use FastAPI, a modern and high-performance web framework.

    Pillow: To handle image processing and manipulation, use the Python Imaging Library (Pillow).

    MIDIUtil: To generate and manipulate MIDI files for music generation, use the MIDIUtil library.

Here's a suggested boilerplate project structure to get started:

In this structure:

    app contains the main application logic, with FastAPI endpoints, models, and services.
    app/api contains the API endpoints for generating images and music.
    app/models defines the input and output data structures for the API.
    app/services contains the logic for interacting with the AI models and handling image and music processing.
    app/main.py is the entry point for the application.
    tests contains test files for the image and music generation components.
    Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are for containerizing the application using Docker and Docker Compose.
    pyproject.toml is used by Poetry to manage dependencies.
    requirements.txt lists the required packages for the project.
    README.md contains project documentation and setup instructions.

With this structure, you can develop the proof-of-concept while maintaining a modular and organized codebase, making it easier to expand the project later.
